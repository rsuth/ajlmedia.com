                        Let us worry about the presentation so that you can focus on your case. 
                        With a "hot seat" trial tech, all you have to do is call out an exhibit and it will appear on the screen in under a second.
                        Our trial techs are experts at "on the fly" video editing, so that any part of your videotaped depositions
                        can be played at any time, making impeaching the witness much more impactful.
